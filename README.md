# PDLex

PDLex is a small C++ prototype for a simple `.pd` language. It started as a lexer and grew into a tiny parser/interpreter that can read a file, build a lightweight AST, and execute a few basic statements.

This repository is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for the full text.

## What It Can Do

- Tokenize identifiers, numbers, strings, booleans, operators, and punctuation
- Ignore `//` single-line comments and `/* ... */` block comments
- Parse variable declarations and reassignments
- Parse `print(...)` statements with multiple arguments
- Parse `input(...)` statements
- Parse and execute `for` loops
- Evaluate basic arithmetic expressions with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`
- Evaluate comparison operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Parse and execute `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements

## Language Snapshot

The current language supports a small subset of statements:

- `int`, `double`, `string`, and `bool` variable declarations
- Reassignment with `name = expression;`
- `print(...)` for values and variables
- `input(...)` to accept user input
- `for (init, condition, update)` loops
- `if`, `else if`, `else` control flow
- String literals with escape support for `\n`, `\t`, `\"`, and `\\`

Example:

```pd
int x = 10;
double y = 40.2;
string first_name = "Pranish";
string last_name;
bool ok = true;

int sum = x + 10;

input("Lastname: " , last_name);
print("Hello," + first_name + last_name);
print("Sum:" + sum);
print(ok);

if (sum > 15)
{
    print("sum is greater than 15");
}
else if (sum == 20)
{
    print("sum is exactly 20");
}
else
{
    print("sum is 15 or less");
}

for (int i = 0, i < 3, i++)
{
    print(i);
}
```

## Build

Use any C++17-compatible compiler. With `cmake`, build it like this:

```bash
cmake --build .
```

If you prefer a different output name, change `-o ppi` to whatever you want in the `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Run

Pass a `.pd` file to the executable (if compiled in Release):

```bash
./build/Release/ppi examples/test.pd
```

On Windows (Release):

```powershell
build\Release\ppi.exe examples\test.pd
```

On Linux/Mac (Debug):

```bash
./build/Debug/ppi examples/test.pd
```

On Windows (Debug):

```powershell
build\Debug\ppi.exe examples\test.pd
```

## Example Files

- `test.pd` — exercises declarations, arithmetic, comments, printing, and input
- `if.pd` — exercises if, else if, and else control flow with various conditions
- `for.pd` — exercises `for` loops, `i++`, `i--`, reassignment in loop bodies, and negative number initializers

These are good starting points if you want to see the current syntax in action.

## Notes

- The interpreter is intentionally simple and only covers a subset of expressions and statements.
- `print(...)` outputs arguments separated by spaces.
- Comparison operators return `1` for true and `0` for false when assigned to a variable.
- `for` loop updates support simple single-step increments/decrements like `i++` and `i--`.
- If you want a larger step, handle it in the loop body instead of the update slot.

## Project Files

- `main.cpp` — program entry point and statement dispatch
- `lexer.cpp` / `lexer.h` — tokenization
- `AST.cpp` / `AST.h` — parsing into AST nodes
- `interpreter.cpp` / `interpreter.h` — execution of parsed nodes
- `examples/test.pd` — sample input file
- `examples/if.pd` — if statement test file

## Status

This is still a work-in-progress toy language, but it is a solid base for experimenting with lexing, parsing, and interpretation in C++.
